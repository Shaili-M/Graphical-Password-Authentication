# Graphical-Password-Authentication
Project Description

This project is about how we can enhance the existing authentication system by using a series of images along with a textual password. The idea is about how a Graphical password system works. Here , a user sets a textual password followed by which he can select different locations from a series of images he gets which will be known to user himself ,and will be stored in database as his password . Later when user logs in , he will be able to login only if he enters the textual password correctly along with the correct locations on the images . This thus , helps reducing the risk of the account being hacked by a third person as the locations cannot be predicted easily by any intruder . Thus ,increasing the security of the system.
